# Sudo and root user

 When you work with a form of Linux,  quickly encounter the **'sudo'** command and the term **'root'**, but what is sudo / root? 

#### Root

A Linux server has a root user, which you can compare with the administrator on a Windows computer. This root user has full access and rights to the operating system of your server by default

#### Sudo

Many [command-line commands](https://www.transip.eu/knowledgebase/entry/594-want-to-use-commandline-ssh//?utm_source=knowledge%20base) can only be executed by a root user. However, if you work via [SSH](https://www.transip.eu/knowledgebase/entry/594-want-to-use-commandline-ssh//?utm_source=knowledge%20base) or  you will usually be logged in as a different user at first. 

To be able to execute commands as root user as this \(non-root\) user, the **'Sudo'** command is used, which stands for **'super user do'**. 

You use **'sudo'** by placing it in front of the command you want to execute, for example

```text
sudo nano /var/log/example
```

The root userâ€™s password is then requested before the command is actually executed. The password is remembered for 15 minutes. During this time you won't be prompted again for your password

### Switching to the root user <a id="switching_to_the_root_user"></a>

You can switch from a regular user to the root user. Thereafter, you do not have to place **'sudo'** in front of the commands that you execute. Because we are running this setup on a local machine and we are not worried about the security  we will run all of our commands at root . To switch to the root user use this command 

```text
sudo su
```

 With the **'exit'** command, you switch back to your user account
