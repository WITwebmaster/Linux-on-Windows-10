# Introduction to windows 10 subsystem

The Windows Subsystem for Linux lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a virtual machine.

You can:

1. Choose your favorite Linux distributions [from the Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/wslstore).
2. Run common command-line free software such as `grep`, `sed or awk`
3. Run Bash shell scripts and inux command-line applications including:
   * Tools: vim, emacs, nano
   * Languages: Javascript/node.js, Ruby, Python, C/C++, C\# & F\#, Rust, Go, etc.
   * Services: sshd, MySQL, Apache, lighttpd
4. Install additional software using own Linux distribution package manager.
5. Invoke Windows applications using a Unix-like command-line shell.
6. Invoke Linux applications on Windows
