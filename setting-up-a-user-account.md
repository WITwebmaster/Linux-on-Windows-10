# Setting up a user account

You should now be able to run Ubuntu as a program, you can pick it off the windows start menu

{% hint style="info" %}
 A warning, **choose a username that is different than any of your Windows usernames**; Iâ€™ve encountered weird permission issues when having the same username for both, plus it gets confusing on the command line if you see the same username everywhere.
{% endhint %}

Once you run the Ubuntu program it will begin setup and ask you to create a user and setup a password. This user has full root level permissions using **sudo** command

Once you have setup a user then begin by updating Ubuntu and outdated packages using this command 

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
```
